# Ride-sharing-Application-design
Ride sharing application with additional features and Used Nash equilibrium for pricing(Sudden surge of people, cilamte change, traffic, demand)
In the ever-changing scenario of urban mobility, the time has never been riper for the
introduction of smarter integrated transport systems that keep users in focus. Conventional ride-
hailing systems such as Uber or Ola, while popular, face their own share of challenges: pricing
models are unpredictable, integration with public transport is poor, vehicle utilization remains
inefficient, and no options exist for users that personalize their choices. The acceleration of
urbanization in Indian cities calls for immediate installation of one more united low-cost
intelligent mobility solution serving not only individual passengers but also sustainable
transport systems in cities.
Experienced by a diverse range of features that cater for passenger and driver needs,
this application now has the centerpiece- a voice-enabled booking assistant that allows ride
booking through voice commands by the user making it more accessible, and hands-free
making it more efficient than the app-based. This makes it the most convenient solution for the
mobility-impaired people, visually impaired users, and people unfamiliar with a smartphone-
like interface.
Our proposed system innovatively looks at this space by designing a Smart Ride
Sharing Platform that could rise above and beyond the constraints of existing services. The
core of our application constitutes a game-theoretic pricing engine based on Nash equilibrium,
dynamically computing the fare by considering real-time traffic, weather conditions, route
demand, and ride-sharing preference. This way the fare remains fairly divided between both
the passenger and the driver, thus resolving the far-stretched dilemma of unfair surge pricing.
In addition, the platform allows passengers to very expressly select ride sharing and get
incentives in the form of slightly reduced fares for the choice. Through the Hop-In feature,
users with overlapping routes can easily join an ongoing shared ride, hence improving fuel
efficiency while reducing costs per user. This is unlike other existing systems. It also provides
a Rent-a-Driver-on-demand service, under which users can hire a driver on an hourly basis-an
exclusive package ideal for older persons, professionals, and non-drivers needing an additional
hand in running errands, shopping, or attending events. Another key capability for defining
would be the addition of food and grocery deliveries along shared routes by the service. If a
delivery coincides with a passenger trip, then that corresponding driver gets assigned as such-
an added logistical efficiency and more driver revenue without additional miles driven.
Premium, fixed pricing is presented to those who would rather have guaranteed pricing, and
surge pricing is strictly capped at 1.5x, making this value-v-great platform for pretty much
anyone.
Safety is ingrained in such systems, where an emergency SOS feature will assure the
swiftest ride to aid in any stressful situation. Real-time sources like Uber Fares Dataset, GTFS
traffic feeds, and Indian transport data are combined to sense the hotspots and optimize driver-
passenger allocation dynamically. All in all, this platform unites the best in ride-hailing, public
transportation integration, delivery services, and driver rentals into what constitutes a future-
ready urban mobility system.
